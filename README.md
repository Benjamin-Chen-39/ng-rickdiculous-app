# Rickfans of Mortydom

You're building a fan site for Rick and Morty lovers. The application will use data from an open source API. Your task is to use that data to design the app.

## About HTTP Client

HTTP Client allows your Angular application to communicate with other applications. Because Angular specializes in dynamically displaying data, it usually needs to fetch that data from other APIs.

HTTP Client is a built-in service for sending and receiving data.

The API offers a REST backend that can be used to access the data:
